## 📝 Description
This project is a combination of two main parts: a backend RESTful API 🖥️ and a frontend React Single Page Application (SPA) 🌐. 

The system operates on several key components:
- **MySQL Database**: Used for storing orders 📦.
- **External Payment Gateway**: Handles the processing of payments 💳.
- **Log Store**: Utilized for system monitoring 🔍.

Both the API and the website maintain separate codebases and are hosted on distinct Azure Git Repositories ☁️. They are containerized 📦 and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster 🐳. The Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes are managed using Jenkins 🔧.

## 🎁 Deliverables
1. A system diagram detailing the aforementioned components and their interconnections 🔗.
2. A flow diagram illustrating the steps involved in the Jenkins CI/CD pipelines 🔄.
3. A basic Helm chart for deploying the backend API to the Kubernetes cluster ⛵.
